Tasks to be done: 
                - Study the influence of the projected dimension (15,30,50,100) to select the NN
                - Implement regularization techniques. Also, regularizing the encoder's output with a Lasso can be a good idea. 
                - implement a denoising autoencoder. Use additive zero-mean Gaussian noise of a given (tunable) variance as injected noise. Analyze the performance as a function of the variance.
