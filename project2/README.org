Tasks to be done:
    Split trainset into train 80% and valid 20%
    Evaluate the reliability diagram and the ECE in the test set with sklearn functions
    Implement a basic temperature scaling (Platt's scaling)
    optional:Repeat the same experiment for a much bigger model obtained after fine-tuning 
        a pre-trained model's last classification layer. Note that if you use a model pre-trained over 
        a different database, you probably have to re-adapt the input dimensionality.
